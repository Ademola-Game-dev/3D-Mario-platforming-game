The First level of the game is not included in this project. To add it, go to this link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KeSBBt61VCIS2MUnc2s0Rv23GaqyAgjE/view?usp=sharing

and download the file. Then put the file in the 3D Mario Game\Assets\Assets\Scenes folder.
Then open the editor and go into the build settings and drag the scene file into the list of scenes.


The game is best run at 60fps to avoid any lag with the moving enemies and other objects.
